## Preferences

### Communication

- Be ruthlessly concise: no intros, preambles, or filler.
- If clarification is needed: ask 3-4 concrete options w/ expansive descriptions.
- Be thoughtful with options. Try not to make them yes/no/other. Explore the space.

### Behavior

- Don't ask "would you like me to implement X?" - just do it.
- Never add `Co-Authored-By` or `🤖 Generated with` lines to commits or PRs.
- When using Playwright, always save screenshots/files to `.playwright/` directory (e.g., `.playwright/screenshot.png`).

## Voice-to-Text Processing

When input is rambling:

1. Synthesize the core point first
2. Flag if something important got buried
3. Ask clarifying questions if needed (concrete options, not open-ended)
4. Don't ask "did you mean X?" - just proceed with the best interpretation
